This project is intend to track the employee by creating a geofence region. Each employee will be provided with a mobile application. The mobile application coordinates and works with GPS inbuilt in the mobile. Their in-time and out-time is recorded in the cloud with their id.
Through the Geo-Fence property when a person enters the geofence region the status is automatically updated.
The person is also intimated through the mobile app when he enters and exits the region
